INSTALLING

Download CubeModLoader.fip from https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases and place it in your Cube World folder (should be Steam\steamapps\common\Cube World). Make a folder called `mods` in your Cube World folder and put the `.dll` (which can be found in the releases) in that `mods` folder.
